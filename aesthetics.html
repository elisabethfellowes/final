  <tr><td><img src="images/elta.jpeg"  alt = "Photo of Elta beauty product"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption"> Sunscreens!! Which is your favorite? Do you rotate them? I’ve been loving my Eltamdskincare tinted sunscreen, and my Bioreus kept me burn free when I was in Austin. I’ve also been test driving the Farmacybeauty green screen and enjoy how quickly it soaks in! For make-up I love my Replenix matte, but because I don’t use the full amount for sun protection, I always have some sunscreen underneath as well. Remember, it’s not additive! Use a tablespoon of sunscreen on your face and neck </td></tr>

  <tr><td><img src="images/florian.jpeg" alt = "Photo of Florian beauty product"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption">Mornings where I’m in a rush (which lets be real, is most mornings when the alarm goes off at 4:30a) I have a quick skin care and makeup routine to wake me up and nourish my skin. Kerstin Florian Thermal Tonic, Paulaschoice 2% BHA liquid, Olay Regenerist serum, the current Origins GinZing eye cream I’m trying out, the new addition of Glossier Boy Brow (to replace Brow Whiz), and my go to Covergirl Clump Crusher. Not pictured - sunscreen! </td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/goodgenes.jpeg" alt = "Good Genes beauty product"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption">This was a definite repurchase for me. Good Genes is a lactic acid exfoliant, with 5% lactic acid (sixth ingredient), licorice and lemongrass for brightening (last two ingredients, fifteen and sixteen), and aloe for soothing (fifth ingredient). It also has squalene which is a very moisturizing ingredient for me (ninth ingredient). I find this light lotion acts more like a serum, and I use it every other night when I don’t use a retinoid. It brightens my skin, helps moderately with texture, and leaves it feeling amazingly soft. The softness is primarily what drove this repurchase! </td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/greenclean.jpeg" alt = "Greenclean mask"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption">Loving my Farmacybeauty full size green clean — leaves my skin soft, doesn’t sting my eyes when I use it to remove mascara, and has such a fresh and light scent. I also love the melt in your hands texture. I use it after oil cleansing, or alone if I don’t need a double cleanse. How do you use your green clean? Next on my list by their brand is the green screen sunscreen! </td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/mask.jpeg" alt = "Face mask"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption">The Ole Henriksen mask has been helpful in calming the skin reaction I had to the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro moisturizer (I’m fairly sure I reacted to the yeast in the product, but not sure yet what the offending agent was). The kaolin clay and chamomile in the mask are soothing, and it hasn’t dried my skin out in the process. Chamomile has anti-inflammatory properties (just see @theilluum and her posts for proof!), and kaolin helps absorb oil and skin debris that you wash off with the mask. Anyone else have rescue masks? </td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="images/tatcha.jpeg" alt = "Tatcha beauty product"/></td></tr>
  <tr><td class = "caption">A few of my current favorite things: Narsissist foundation in groenland, Becca Cosmetics highlighter in champagne, Tatcha camellia oil cleanser, Fresh Beauty lip balm, and Bobbi Brown blush brick. Simple routines for tough mornings, but still leave the house feeling glam. </td></tr></table>
